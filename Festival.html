  <p>Gandhi Jayanti is a national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd every year to mark the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, who is considered the Father of the Nation. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi or Bapu, was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat.<br>

    Gandhi Jayanti is observed to honor Gandhi's significant contribution to India's struggle for independence through non-violent civil disobedience and satyagraha (passive resistance). His teachings of truth, nonviolence, and peaceful coexistence remain relevant and influential worldwide.<br>
    
    On this day, various events and programs are organized across the country to pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi's life and achievements. These may include prayer meetings, commemorative ceremonies, seminars, debates, essay competitions, cultural performances, and exhibitions showcasing Gandhi's life and work.<br>
    
    It's common for people to visit Gandhiji's memorial at Raj Ghat in Delhi or other Gandhi-related landmarks across the country to offer prayers and pay their respects. Additionally, schools, colleges, and other educational institutions often hold special events to educate students about the principles and values Gandhi stood for.</p>
